# ML-Algorithms-from-Scratch

This project is aimed to implement several ML algorithms from scratch, including cross-validation with respect to [RMSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-mean-square_deviation). The implementation is done using the [Boston Housing Prices Data Set](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/weber/emp/_session_3/boston.htm). 

The implemented algorithms include: 

* Local Linear Regression for Prediction 
* Basic Nearest Neighbor
* K-Nearest Neighbors
* [Forward Selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepwise_regression)
